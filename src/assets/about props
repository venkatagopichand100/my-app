Component:
Part of the user interface and it is core building block of the React.
An application comprises of muliple small components.
Small components combined together and form the entire UI.
Components can be nested inside one another. 

Components code are placed in the Javascript 

Example: app.js is the which is the component we will called as app component.

There are two types of components we have 
1) Functional Component
2) Class component


1) Functional Component:

Functional component is a Javascript function that accepts input called Props(properties) and returns HTML which describes the UI

function Welcome(props){

return <h1>Hi hello {props.name}</h1>

}

//This function is a valid react functional component becuase its accepts a single prop and returns a react element.


2) class component

A class component is nothing but reqular class that extend from the react's component class

Class component must contain a render method which retuns HTML code

class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render(){
        return <h1> hi hello {this.props.name}
    }
}
