//props are objects that hold information to control the behaviour of the component
//the problem with props are they are immutable and we shouldn't change it 

//State is also an object that hold some information but that information may change over the lifetime of that component


differences b/w props and react

1) props
pass from the parent to child component
props are immutable
props can be accessed as props and will be passed a the param to the function


2) State
contained inside the component
state can be changed (mutable)
useState hook (lifecycle hook in the functional component)
they are like varibles declared in the function body
