State:
    Data that changes as the user interacs with the application
    when the data changes, react will update the content on the screen automatically
    This is one and only way we can change the that what content reacts show

function App(){
    const [cricketCount, setCricketCount] = useState(0);
    const handleClick = () =>{
       setCricketCount(cricketCount + 1)
       //setCricketCount is nothing but the function setter funciton used to update our piece of state
       //cricketCount the piece of state which initial is 0 and will update over the time
    }
    return(
        <div>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Add cricketers</button>
            <p>added the cricketers count is {cricketCount}</p>
        </div>
    )
}

1) useState() -> define a piece of state using the react hook(funciton) called useState function
2) useState(0) -> we have to provide the value to the useState funciton. this is the default, stating value of our state
3) {cricketCount} -> use the state value to show the output the user
4) setCricketCount(cricketCount + 1) -> when the user do something, update the piece of state and it will render in the component
