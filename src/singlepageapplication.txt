1) single page application 
SPA will have the main page loaded once and then the sub page sections will be changing without any refresh
SPA is the modren way of web developement which will be fast and responsive

2) multi page application
Entire page will be getting reloaded everytime
traditional approach 


Notes to configure the Routes

1) The first step to configure the router is giving a top level or hige order component names <BrowserRouter>
2) All the routes and components will be wrapped inside the <BrowserRouter> component as it will 
store the clear URL's internally, using which we actually route through all the components means entire application

Meaning route -> navigating from one page to another page


a) <BrowserRouter>
example: 
ReactDOM.createRoot(el).render(
<BrowserRouter>
<App />
</BrowserRouter>
);

b) we need to import import { Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

c) {/* to show the child routes into our application we have to use <Outlet /> */}

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

index attribute which will refers to the parent Route
"index" attribute will point the route to its parent Route
default value will be true for the index in the Routes
       <Route index element = {   <Home />  } />

d) context and useOutletContext() : passing data from parent component to the child component

if wanted to share the date, like sharing the data from the child component we to use an attribute called "context"
that can used in the <Outlet /> component

<Outlet context = {Object} />
with the context attribute we can pass the data as the Object Literal 

The Object is passed to the the child component and to refer the passed data inside the child component 
we have to use useOutletContext() hook(function)

//useOutletContext() hook help to get the data which is passed with the "context" attribute inside the <Outlet /> component

//state and useLocation() hook, this is the correct way we have to share the data
