1) single page application 
SPA will have the main page loaded once and then the sub page sections will be changing without any refresh
SPA is the modren way of web developement which will be fast and responsive

2) multi page application
Entire page will be getting reloaded everytime
traditional approach 


Notes to configure the Routes

1) The first step to configure the router is giving a top level or hige order component names <BrowserRouter>
2) All the routes and components will be wrapped inside the <BrowserRouter> component as it will 
store the clear URL's internally, using which we actually route through all the components means entire application

Meaning route -> navigating from one page to another page


a) <BrowserRouter>
example: 
ReactDOM.createRoot(el).render(
<BrowserRouter>
<App />
</BrowserRouter>
);

b) we need to import import { Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
